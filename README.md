# UTAT Avionics Flight Telemetry Core (2017)

This software repository includes the main codebase for the University of Toronto Aerospace Team (UTAT) 
Deliverance II Hybrid Rocket flight telemetry software. This code was initially written by Samuel Looper 
and Michael Ding. This code is written for Arduino Mega 2560, and is mostly comprised of diagnostic and 
evaluation scripts for sensor suites and radio telemetry systems.
